# The-White-Noise-Project
High quality audio matters everywhere, even in noise. Been tended to create the perfect, I create with high standard, almost perfect. Therefore, I started **The White Noise Project**. Its main goal is creating extremely high quality noise. Also, I wanted to learn how to use **Kendryte210 RISC-V CPU**. So as to do so, I used it instead of PC. Whole operation can be done in PC; however, I wouldn't gain experience, if I didn't use K210. 
## Outline of Operation
### 1. Creation of Random Variables
In this section, K210 is used. The chip created random variables then logged it into SD. The chip is mounted on Maixduino and it programmed with micropython. Whenever you save a file ,which is named as "*boot.py*", in SD card, micropython core executes it firstly. The boot.py includes instructions for creating millions of random variables and saving them into SD card.
### 2. Post Processing of Random Variables
   In this phase, a PC is used. The computer analyzed the saveded randoms then created a **.wav** file. The file is [available here](https://s6.dosya.tc/server6/b8zj6v/white-noise.wav.html)
At the and of the project, **extremely high quality audio, 320000 Kbps,** is created.
